# AWS Extension

The Blockless Rust SDK's AWS S3 extension allows you to interact with the aws service.
This allows to configure aws s3, manage bucket commands, and perform operations such as listing, reading, writing, and deleting objects in s3 buckets.

### Key Components

- **Bucket**: Provides functionalities to interact with the bucket.
- **BucketListResponse & BucketListContent**: Structures to store responses from the list operation.

### 1. Bucket

`Bucket` builder struct provides the main interface for performing operations on S3 buckets.

- **Fields**:
  - `bucket_name`: Name of the bucket.
  - `s3config`: Configuration settings for the bucket (type `AWSS3Configure`).

- **Methods**:
  - `new(bucket_name: String, s3config: AWSS3Configure)`: Creates a new `Bucket` object.
  - `list(&self, prefix: &str)`: Lists objects in the bucket with an optional prefix.
  - `get_object(&self, path: &str)`: Retrieves an object from the bucket.
  - `put_object(&self, path: &str, content: &mut [u8])`: Uploads an object to the bucket.
  - `delete_object(&self, path: &str)`: Deletes an object from the bucket.
  - `get_bucket_command(&self)`: Generates a bucket command to interact with the S3 bucket.

### 2. BucketListResponse & BucketListContent

- **BucketListResponse**: Holds the response when listing objects in a bucket.
  - `name`: The name of the bucket.
  - `prefix`: The prefix (optional).
  - `is_truncated`: Indicates if the list is truncated.
  - `contents`: List of `BucketListContent` representing the objects in the bucket.

- **BucketListContent**: Stores metadata for each object in the bucket.
  - `last_modified`: Timestamp of the last modification.
  - `e_tag`: Entity tag (optional).
  - `storage_class`: Storage class (optional).
  - `key`: The key of the object.
  - `size`: The size of the object.

### Error Handling

The operations return `Result` types, with possible errors wrapped in `AWSS3ErrorKind`.
